##Adherence to the DASH diet was assessed with an index variable (ie, a score) comprising 8 DASH food groups (grains, vegetables, fruits, dairy, meat, nuts/seeds/legumes, fats/oils, and sweets),23,24 as described in detail.13 For each food group, a maximum score of 10 could be achieved when the intake met the recommendation, and lower intakes were scored proportionately. Reverse scoring was applied for meat, fats/oils, and sweets, and a score of 0 was applied to intakes â‰¥200% of the upper recommended level. The resulting 8 component scores were summed to create the overall DASH adherence score, which ranged from 0 to 80. Following the DASH eating plan guidelines,24 we assigned each individual the energy level closest to his or her estimated energy requirement on the basis of age, sex, and physical activity.13
